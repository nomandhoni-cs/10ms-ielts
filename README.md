# Course Landing Page - Next.js & Tailwind CSS

This project is a dynamic, fully-featured course landing page built with **Next.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It is designed to be a type-safe, component-based application that fetches all its content from the [10 Minute School API](https://api.10minuteschool.com).

The page presents a comprehensive overview of a course, including instructor details, features, downloadable resources, key learning points, student testimonials, and a fully functional, debounced search component.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Next.js Image Domains (`next.config.js`)

This project uses `next/image` for optimized image loading. To prevent "unconfigured host" errors, ensure that all external image domains are whitelisted in your `next.config.js` file.

**Example `next.config.js`:**

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'cdn.10minuteschool.com',
        pathname: '**',
      },
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 's3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com',
        pathname: '**',
      },
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'img.youtube.com', // For video thumbnails
        pathname: '**',
      },
      // Add other external image domains here if needed
    ],
  },
  /* other config options */
};

export default nextConfig;
```

> **Note:** Remember to restart your development server after making any changes to `next.config.js`.

## üîé Functional SearchBox Component

A standout feature is the **`SearchBar`** component, which provides a live search experience.

-   **Debounced API Calls**: It uses a custom `useDebounce` hook to delay API requests until the user has stopped typing for 300ms, preventing excessive network traffic.
-   **Live Suggestions**: Fetches and displays a dropdown of relevant search results as the user types.
-   **API Endpoint**: It integrates with the following `10 Minute School` search API:
    ```
    https://api.10minuteschool.com/discovery-service/api/v1/search/guides?query=YOUR_QUERY
    ```
-   **Rich Results**: The component correctly renders results that contain HTML, such as `<mark>` tags for highlighting the search term.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Structure

The application is structured for scalability and clarity.

-   **`app/`**: Contains the main routing and page layouts, following the Next.js App Router convention.
-   **`components/`**: Holds all reusable React components (`Navbar`, `SearchBar`, `CourseHeader`, etc.).
-   **`lib/`**: Core logic and utilities.
    -   `lib/course/types.ts`: Centralized TypeScript interfaces for all API data structures.
    -   `lib/utils.ts`: Utility functions (e.g., for `cn` from `clsx`).
-   **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks, such as `useDebounce`.
